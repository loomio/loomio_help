Many people share the benefits of Loomio with their friends in other organizations.

If you purchase an annual Loomio Pro plan, we’ll give you a one-time **$199 Loomio credit** to give to any group of your choice. You could sponsor a community group for life. Your chosen group can also choose to use it to upgrade or purchase a new plan such as a Loomio Starter plan for $199. They can even put the credit towards their own Loomio Pro plan.¹
