## Overview
Loomio exists to make it easy for anyone, anywhere, to participate in decisions that affect their lives.

<!-- Our vision is to help organizations like yours work better together, now and into the future. -->

As a social enterprise and worker cooperative, our values are reflected in both the design of the software and how we operate as a business.

We do not monetize your data or attention. We will never sell your data or use it for advertising purposes. You are free to export your data at any time.

### Inclusive pricing model
Our goal is to provide Loomio to as many people as possible, while also developing the Loomio platform so it can better serve you.

To sustainably work towards our vision, we have structured our pricing based on the type of organization we serve.  

We aim to offer a competitive price for enterprise organizations, an affordable price for self-service groups, and special rates for community and volunteer groups.

Loomio is open source software, and you are free to set up your own instance of Loomio.


## Subscription plans

### Variable Pricing
When you invite new people into your group, you will be charged for the new people at a pro-rated amount for the current billing cycle. 

Loomio checks the number of people in your group daily for monthly plans, and weekly for annual plans. 

> **Example:** Mary has a Basic monthly plan for her group of 20 people, with billing of $20.00 due on the 1st of the month.

> On the 15th of the month (half-way through the current billing cycle), 10 new people join Mary's group. Mary’s account is charged 10 people x $1.00 x 15 days remaining / 30 days in current month = $5.00. Payment is drawn from the card on file immediately.

> At the next monthly billing renewal date, Mary is charged $30.00 (total of 30 people x $1.00 for the next month).

> Mary receives a monthly statement detailing the charges processed.

If the number of people in your group decreases, the price will reduce accordingly at the next billing cycle (monthly or annually). All payments are in advance and no credit is provided.

Annual plans operate in a similar way. Loomio checks for new people in the group weekly and automatically charges the card on file.

### 25% discount for annual plans if upgrade during free trial period
The 25% discount for annual plans applies at the time of upgrade, and then for each new member joining your group throughout the first year of subscription.
