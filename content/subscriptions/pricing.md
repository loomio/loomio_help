# Overview

Loomio exists to make it easy for anyone, anywhere, to participate in decisions that affect their lives.

As a social enterprise and worker cooperative, our values are reflected in both the design of the software and how we operate as a business.

We do not monetize your data or attention. We will never sell your data or use it for advertising purposes. You own your own content and you are free to export your data at any time.

## Inclusive pricing model
Our goal is to provide Loomio to as many people as possible, while also developing the Loomio platform so it can better serve you.

To sustainably work towards our vision, we have structured our pricing based on the type of organization we serve.

We aim to offer a competitive price for enterprise organizations, an affordable price for businesses, nonprofit organizations, and special rates for community groups.

Loomio is open source software, and you are free to set up your own instance of Loomio.

# Loomio subscription plans
Simple, easy to understand pricing to encourage regular Loomio use and allow your group to grow without restriction.  

A Loomio subscription is one price per group, and there is no limit on the number of subgroups you can have.

This means you can invite everyone in your organization into your group!

## Free trial
All new groups start on a free trial, so you can evaluate Loomio with your group.

Free trials are for 30 days, limited to 20 people and 20 threads.

[Contact us](https://www.loomio.org/contact) if you need to extend your trial.

At the end of the trial period you will be asked to upgrade to a paid subscription plan.

## Community Lifetime plan
We encourage community and volunteer groups with a special one-time price for lifetime use of Loomio for your group.

The Community Lifetime plan is available for community groups and organizations run by volunteers who have no full-time paid staff.

Price: $US 199.00 one-time price for life.

Community Lifetime plan includes:
- Loomio standard features
- Unlimited members (Contact us if you need to go over 1,000 members)
- Unlimited threads and decisions
- Unlimited subgroups

To access these special rates, apply for our Community Lifetime plan when you upgrade your group.

We will ask you to make a declaration that your group has no full-time staff.

When you have completed the form, you may continue to set up the Community active plan immediately. You do not need to wait for a response from us. We trust you and will contact you if we need to query your application.

We will check in with you once a year, near the annual renewal date of your plan, to see if you are still actively using Loomio and if your organization still meets the criteria for the Community plan.

If your group has acquired funding and at least one full-time staff member, we will invite you to upgrade to Loomio Starter or Pro plans.

This plan is “self-service” with limited support. However you can learn all you need to use Loomio effectively with [Loomio Help](https://help.loomio.org) which includes the user manual and guides.

## Training
Loomio Pro plan training and implementation support is delivered via webinar and/or video conference.

- Implementation support to help you get your Loomio group started and engage with members
- On-demand webinars to refresh your use of Loomio, ask questions and introduce new features.

Bespoke training for your organization is tailored to your needs or your group.
