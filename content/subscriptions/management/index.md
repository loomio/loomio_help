## Introduction
Loomio uses the Chargify billing and subscription management service to manage subscription records, initiate payments, process upgrades and cancellations.

Prices are based on debit/credit card payment via an automated billing portal.

## Upgrading your group
To continue to use Loomio beyond your free trial, you can upgrade your group to Basic or Pro plans, or apply for special rates available for Community & Volunteer member groups. 

You may upgrade your group at any time.

## Multiple group consolidation
If you have several groups, you may wish to consolidate these under a single group subscription.  In most cases we can move groups to become subgroups of a parent group. To do this, please [contact us](https://www.loomio.org/contact).

Groups moved to become subgroups retain all privacy and member permissions.

## Automatic payment and statement generation
Payments via Chargify are automatic either monthly or annually, and a statement is issued on successful payment.

You can update card and contact details at any time using the secure Account Management link to the billing portal. Look for the  'Account Management'  link at the bottom of the statement.

## Billing problems
If Chargify is unable to process a payment to your card when due, an email notification will be sent to the email address we have on file, along with a link to the billing portal where you can update card details.   The billing system will continue to retry the payment once a week, and if payment is not successful after four (4) attempts, the subscription plan will be cancelled (day 28).

The billing system will issue an alert via email when your credit card is nearing expiry.

Card payment problems are sometimes caused by bank restrictions. Please make sure your credit or debit card is authorized for  "international payments" and "internet transactions" ("Prch" and "Auth"). 

## Alternate payment options
Alternate payment options are only available for annual Basic and Pro plan subscriptions.

### Bank transfer payment
We accept payment via bank transfer for payment within 20 days of invoice.

### Manual invoices
There is a 10% administration charge for manual invoice and purchase order processing.

### Other currencies
Invoices raised in currencies other than in USD are converted at the daily Telegraphic Transfer rate plus 5%.

## Upgrade your plan
To upgrade from trial, go to your group page and click the 'Upgrade' button or [visit the upgrade page](https://www.loomio.org/upgrade).

You will see a list of all the groups you belong to.

Find the group you wish to upgrade and click the Upgrade link.

Select the subscription plan you wish to purchase and click ‘Pay monthly’ or ‘Pay yearly’
This link takes you to the Loomio billing portal operated by Chargify.  Here you can set up your subscription.  Check the details of plan, price and payment frequency in the Plan Summary table are correct.

Enter or copy/paste a coupon code if applicable and confirm that the price has been adjusted accordingly.

Complete the required fields to set up your subscription, including:

- Customer Information (name and email address)

Confirm details and click the ‘Place my order’ button.

The subscription is activated immediately and your group automatically upgraded.  You will receive a tax invoice/statement confirming successful payment.

Follow that link to the billing portal, then:

1. Find ‘Plan Details’, click on ‘Cancel’ (on the right).
2. Tell us why you are canceling the plan. 
3. Choose 'Cancel Now' or 'Cancel At End of Period'.

### What happens when a subscription is cancelled?

Your group data and membership remain and you can continue to comment on existing threads and vote on existing decisions, however you will no longer be able to start new threads or invite new members to the group.  

You can reinstate the subscription at any time. If you no longer require the group, you may deactivate it.

## No refund policy
Loomio does not provide refunds for subscription payments.

If you believe a payment has been made in error, contact us with details and we will assess the situation on a case by case basis.
