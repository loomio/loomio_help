## The big picture

To start using Loomio well, you just need to understand four main elements.

![Group → Thread → Proposal → Outcome](loomio_app_ia.png)

**Groups** hold everything in one place for a specific set of people.

Discussion **threads** are where you go to discuss topics and make decisions, using tools such as the **proposal** – or other **polls** – which help you visualize where the group is at on a given proposal, question, or topic.

Finally, you'll use an **outcome** to share what's going to happen next so everyone has a clear understanding and there's a useful record.

At its most basic, Loomio is a forum with tools that help you facilitate conversations and decisions, helping you start and hold conversations that move to clear outcomes.
