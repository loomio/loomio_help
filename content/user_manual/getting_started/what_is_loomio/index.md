Loomio is a simple, user-friendly online tool for collaborative decision-making. Loomio lets you host discussions online, invite the right people to participate, come to timely decisions and transform deliberation into real-world action.

## How it works in four steps

### 1. Gather

![](gather.png)

A Loomio **group** is an online place for people to have **discussions** and make **decisions** together.


### 2. Discuss


![](discuss.png)


Anyone in the group can start a **discussion**. Everyone in the group is able to participate.

### 3. Propose

![](propose.png)

**Proposals** are the defining feature of Loomio. Use a proposal to move a discussion towards **conclusion**. If you're wondering how to move a conversation forward, the answer is almost always to **start a proposal**!

### 4. Decide & Act

![](decide.png)

While a **proposal** is open, everyone in the group can state their **position**:

* **Agree** if you’re happy with the proposal.
* **Abstain** if you’re ok for the group to decide without you.
* **Disagree** if you believe there might be a better alternative.
* **Block** if you’ve got serious objections.

When you select your position, you can also enter a short **statement** to explain why. This creates a succinct **summary** of what everyone thinks.

When the proposal closes, you can post an **outcome** so everyone knows what the **result** was and the **next steps**.

Over time you'll build a **history of decisions** you can refer to.
