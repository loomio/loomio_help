## Not receiving emails from Loomio?
If you cannot find your email code in the email inbox of the account you signed up with – or you started a group and haven't heard from us – **you will likely find it in your spam or junk mail folder.** Then, please white list loomio.org with your email service, or add notifications@loomio.org to your contacts.

## How can I stop my signature being included in email replies to threads?

To be sure that your email signature is not included in your comment when you reply by email, you need to begin your signature with a double hyphen on its own line.

_For example:_

> Best Wishes,<br> \-\-<br>SIGNATURE<br>CONTACT<br>LOGOS ETC

_…emailed in reply to Loomio emails (that invite a reply) will appear as:_

> Best Wishes,
