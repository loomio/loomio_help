Deactivating your group means that you and the rest of the group members will no longer be able to access the group. If you wish to deactivate your group you can do so by selecting **Deactivate Group** from the **Options** menu on the group page. To reactivate your deactivated group, [contact Loomio support](https://loomio.org/contact).
