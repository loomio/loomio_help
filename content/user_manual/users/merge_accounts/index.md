## I have two Loomio accounts under two different email addresses, and I would like to merge them into a single account

 1. Login to Loomio **on the account you wish to replace**
 2. Open the sidebar > Click your name > Edit profile
 3. Enter in your preferred email address, i.e. the email address corresponding with the account you want to keep

 4. A verification email will be sent to your preferred email address, and all you need to do is follow the prompts from there

**N.B. This action is irreversible, but you will have the opportunity to make a final confirmation before it occurs**
