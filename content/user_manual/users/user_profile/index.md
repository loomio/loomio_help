Your profile page lets you customize your Loomio identity. To visit your profile page select the **Edit profile** option in the user menu, which is found by clicking on your name in the top-left of the screen; _if it is closed, click on the menu icon (top-left) to open it._

## Uploading a profile photo
When you first create a Loomio account, your initials will be the default image associated with your profile. You can upload a profile photo by clicking on your picture on the profile page. If you have a [Gravatar](https://en.gravatar.com/) you can set that as your profile picture by selecting **Use Gravatar**. You can also choose for Loomio to use the photo you use for other common platforms/tools.

## Update your personal info

You can update:

* **your name**
* **your email address** - this email receives your Loomio notifications (on, by default)
* **your username** - your username is a name people can use to alert you with an @mention in threads
* **your introduction** - a few lines to let others in your group know more about you
* **your location** - useful for distributed or remote groups so people can get an idea of where others are

## Language settings
Loomio is developed in English, but [is translated by volunteers into many languages](https://www.loomio.org/g/cpaM3Hsv/loomio-community-translation).

Loomio will detect your browser’s language settings, but you can manually set your preferred language from the profile page.
