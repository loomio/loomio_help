## The big picture

There are four main elements to understand.

There are some other details along the way, but understanding just these four is often enough to get your first successful outcome.

1. **Groups** hold everything in one place for a specific set of people

2. Discussion **threads** are where you go to discuss topics and make decisions

3. Use tools such as the **proposal** or other **polls** to help you visualize the group's input and feelings about a given proposal, question, or topic.

4. Finally, set an **outcome** to share what's going to happen next so everyone has a clear understanding and there's a useful record.

At its most basic, Loomio is a forum with tools that help you facilitate conversations and decisions, helping you start and hold conversations that move to clear outcomes.
