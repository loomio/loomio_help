# Text from 'Consent decision making' video (how to on Loomio)

The copy used in the Loomio threads, contexts, proposals, etc. of the Consent decision making 'how to' video:

## Start new thread

### Title (of thread)
Sponsoring a benefit dinner

### Context (of thread)
**Background:** [Here's the invitation](pretend-invitation.link) to donate that we received from our new friend, Jo, from Charity International (met at the conference).

**Why:** I'm proposing this course of action because it's in line with the 'giving back to community' priority we identified at our retreat, and a good opportunity to build relationships.

**Process:** Let's use Integrative Consent to decide if and how we might respond :-)

**Sponsoring a benefit dinner**

If this proposal passes we will sponsor Charity International's upcoming benefit as specified in the thread context, basically meaning we'll...

1. donate $300

2. have our logo on the bill

3. get a free bottle of wine if we buy a table

### Duration
Pointing out the calendar icon that says "Closing in three days" and offers an opportunity to change the date and time

## Comments (in reply to the Questions & Comments)

Mary O'Keefe: I think this will be a nice gesture and simple to do
MJ Kaplan: We have $500 set aside for charity that I doubt we'll use elsewhere; I'd be pleased if we gave it all at once

**Sponsoring a benefit dinner (v2)**

If this proposal passes we will sponsor Charity International's upcoming benefit as specified in the thread context, basically meaning we'll...

1. donate $500

2. have our logo on the bill

3. get a free bottle of wine if we buy a table

## Votes (Integration step)

Objection: Brand risk: Charity International was involved with that recent fiasco... [here's the backlash another group received from supporting them]()

Mary O'Keefe posted the objection.

MJ Kaplan: Agree: Great; thanks for organizing this

## Comments (Integration step)

Mary O'Keefe:
I considered the validation criteria; my objection is _valid._
Let's have an **open discussion** on it as I can't think of an easy way to integrate it right now.
I wonder if there's a better charity we can give to?

Reply from MJ Kaplan:
I called up Kelly from Charity-R-Us and, as luck would have it, they are also doing a charity dinner and they're open for us to support in the same way - at the same level and everything.

## Outcome

We'll proceed with the sponsorship ðŸ™‚
Glad we can play a supportive role in the community; thanks everyone for your input.
@Alex will confirm with Charity-R-Us and I will work with Sam to get them the money by next week.
