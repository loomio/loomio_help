## Adopting Loomio

Top tips & tricks for adoption:

- ***Agree on the scope,*** **and trial it**
 - How are we going to use Loomio? (eg, discussion, decisions, input, or just reporting?)
 - What shall we first use Loomio for, and when will we evaluate success?


- ***Start small,*** **routine tasks** (eg, approve minutes) can be a great start


- ***Raise the stakes,*** **move the action:** want to participate? Join Loomio


- ***Recall why,*** **remind the group** you’ve agreed to use Loomio, and why
 - Conversation by e-mail? Copy & paste discussion back into Loomio
 - Deciding in person? Invite the group to move the decision online
