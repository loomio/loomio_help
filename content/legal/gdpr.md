The EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) came into effect on May 25, 2018. Loomio is GDPR compliant.

## How does the GDPR affect Loomio group owners?

If you have any EU personal data (such as names, email addresses, ID numbers) in your Loomio group, you are a Controller of personal data under the GDPR.

## Loomio Co-operative Limited is a data processor

Processing EU personal data must be governed by a [GDPR-compliant contract](https://gdpr-info.eu/art-28-gdpr/).

We provide a standard [Data Processing Addendum](/legal/LOOMIO_EU_DATA_PROCESSING_ADDENDUM.pdf) (DPA) to extend GDPR privacy principles, rights, and obligations everywhere personal data is processed.

## Third party data processors

Loomio uses third party subprocessors such as cloud computing services to provide our services.

We enter into GDPR-compliant data processing agreements with each party. [Data subprocessors used by Loomio](../third_parties)

## What rights do EU-based Loomio users have under the GDPR?

Under the GDPR, EU-based Loomio users have:

- The right to be [informed](../privacy).
- The right to [access and correct your data](../../user_manual/users/user_profile/).
- The right to [transfer your data](../../user_manual/groups/data_export/) to another service. (Loomio is [open source software](https://github.com/loomio/loomio) and you can host your data yourself)
- The right to [restrict processing](../../user_manual/users/user_profile/#deactivating-your-account).
- The right to [erasure](../../user_manual/users/deleting_your_account/).
