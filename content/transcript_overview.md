Hi, welcome to our quick tour. Loomio aims to eliminate messy email chains and group messages, and time wasted in meetings. Too often, people can’t find what they need, feel unheard, or can’t make the time. Loomio is an online space where groups communicate, organise, and make decisions together, effectively and efficiently. Here’s how it works.

At the highest level, “groups” hold everything in one place for a specific set of people. Groups have discussion threads where we discuss topics and make decisions, using tools like proposals to get input, and outcomes to record decisions.

Here we were deciding on our Q2 plan. Everyone in the group can see this proposal, now passed. We use decisions to move conversations to clear outcomes, and to let us reflect on the topic at hand, now, and as a record we can easily return to in the future.

No more confusion from stuff like reply-all, here is the whole story, all in one place.  Here’s an active proposal; I can share my reasoning with my vote. As the decision progresses, I might change my mind based on what someone else said. After it closes I can share an outcome to notify the group how we’ll proceed.

Loomio supports lots of other kinds of decisions, including finding a time to meet.

Decisions happen in threads, where we go to discuss topics and share relevant files, decisions, and comments.  As we go, we can add any new clarity or questions to the thread context, which always remains at the top, so people joining the conversation later can quickly engage in it.

Groups or sub-groups help ensure the right people are invited every time. When I go to my overarching group, I can see its threads and threads from its sub-groups I’m in, all our documents and assets, and I can access all of my sub-groups. I'll return to this sub-group to see its specific threads or decisions, both active and previous ones.

At the top of every group there is a description. Just like the context of a thread, group descriptions are a place to store all of the information, links, and files that everyone in the group needs, so everything is easily accessible and the group is clear about its purpose.

If you’re trying to improve collaboration for your whole company, your teams, or your project, you can trust Loomio to support better outcomes with less time and effort. You can start a free group for evaluation from our website, and there is comprehensive Help online; feel free to contact us for more support. Happy collaborating.
