Hi, I want to quickly share how we manage our email settings, profile, and notifications in Loomio. In Loomio, members of my group can follow the conversations that matter to them and minimise notifications that aren’t needed. Loomio is a space where groups communicate and make decisions to achieve better outcomes with less time and effort, so getting the settings right for you will improve the experience.

There’s just a few basic settings to get your hands around. We’ll look at each of these four in context.

First I’ll click my picture or initials, and ‘edit profile’. I can change my profile picture, change the username, and change the language in which I use Loomio. Thanks to the awesome volunteers who have translated Loomio, the range of languages continues to grow.

In my Email settings, I can change what Loomio emails me to keep up to date. Even though I use Loomio regularly, I want emails from “Mentions & Replies” to make sure I know when people want to get my attention. The Daily Summary is a great way to get started as everything that I missed yesterday will be summarised for me. If I have some of my notifications turned off, but I want to follow the conversations I’ve engaged with by email, I’ll “Subscribe upon participation”.

For each group I’m in, I have the option to limit my emails to new threads and proposals, to turn off all emails, or be emailed about all activity.

If I turn off emails, I’ll be relying on the notifications I receive in the app, through the bell-shaped drop-down here.

Now, let’s look at a couple ways to manage my notifications for specific threads.

Every thread has a mute button. If I mute a thread, I won’t receive emails unless someone mentions me or replies to a comment I made. I will receive a notification if I’m invited to vote, but I won’t see the thread when looking at the Recent threads or Unread threads page.

If you want to remove a thread from view for the whole group, you can go to thread options and “Close” it. This thread will not appear in the Recent threads page, nor in the group page, unless you use the “closed” toggle on the discussion list.

That’s all you should need to manage your emails, notifications, and settings, and support your group members to do the same. You can always access our comprehensive Help online, and feel free to contact us for more support. Happy collaborating.
