Loomio is open source software, built by a worker-owned cooperative social enterprise. We are based in Aotearoa New Zealand, and are part of the [Enspiral Network.](http://enspiral.com/)

We believe that more groups practicing effective, inclusive decision-making can change organizational dynamics at a global scale. Loomio exists to make it easy for anyone, anywhere, to participate in decisions that affect their lives.

# Story

Loomio began in 2011, when activists from Occupy Wall Street and social entrepreneurs from the Enspiral Network realized they needed to solve the same problem: fast, inclusive, effective decision-making without meetings. In 2012, we formed our cooperative and released a prototype (Loomio Beta). We found that many others around the world needed the same solution.

In 2014, we ran a successful international [crowdfunding campaign](https://www.loomio.org/crowdfunding_celebration), enabling us to work on a new version of the software, Loomio 1.0, which was released the following year. In 2015, we raised a round of ethical capital, and are working to bring collaborative decision-making to millions more people around the world.

# Purpose & Values

**The Loomio Co-operative exists to create a world where it’s easy for anyone to participate in decisions that affect them**

With the right collaborative process, groups generate better ideas, decisions and actions than any individual would by themselves. The Loomio Co-operative aims to break down the barriers to participation in decision-making at every level: in neighbourhoods, community organizations, businesses, social movements, and local and national governance.

**Co-operative social enterprise**

Loomio is a social enterprise collectively owned by the people building it. Unlike a traditional profit­ maximising company, revenue is not an end in itself, but a means towards achieving a core social purpose. A worker-owned cooperative structure is a powerful way to live our values of collaboration and collective ownership.

**Independent and neutral**

Loomio is committed to remaining independent so it can provide a neutral place for any group to come together.

**Open-source collaboration**

Loomio aims to develop open-source tools that make collaboration accessible to everyone.

**Adaptive, reflexive, user-driven**

Loomio aims to develop tools which are iterative, self-reflexive and adaptive, driven by the collective wisdom of the user community.

**Transparency**

The Loomio Co-operative will be surrounded by a valued community of users and contributors. This community must be confident that the Loomio Co-operative is doing what it says it is. We are committed to high standards for sharing information.
