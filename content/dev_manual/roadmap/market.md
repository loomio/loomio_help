## What are we building?

Loomio is a tool for governance, organizational management, working groups and engagement.

It's a place for having discussions, developing & recording decisions and keeping important records and documents all in one place.

It makes governance easier and better by saving people time, and keeping a searchable archive of your information.

After using it for a few months, many users report improved group function and even culture change around decision making.

Peole can discuss topics together, in their own time, this increases engagement and means you have better meetings when you do get together.

You can record decisions and take polls

We're execellent on privacy (you can always export your data)

It's used best by:
- Boards, committees, panels and working groups - that want to document their proccesses and create a searchable archive of their discussions, decisions and documents
- Cooperatives - that have a commitement to collaboration
- Membership owned orgs - that have participatory values at their core and a shared purpose.
- Play centers - that invlove parents and teachers with little time but lots of care
- Activist networks - that want to change the world by harnesseing collective action
- Engagement projects - where you want to facilitate conversation between participants and come to clear outcomes.
- Business - that are adopting distributed management strutures
- Non profits

It solves email pain, provides an environement where truly transformational discussion
can be operatioinalised from clear decisions.

It's got a great desktop app, mobile app, and web app. It's also easy to invlovle people entirely by email as your getting started.

to help you get started, paying groups can attend getting started and facilitation coaching webinars with groups similar to themselves, we also have
community ranked news and articles.

In terms of privacy, we can't be beat:
- Spectacular GDPR complicance.
- No ads, ever. Infact, no third party trackers at all. (no google analytics, no 3rd party support software, just a billing system).
- You can export all of your group data at any time, this can then be imported into your own server.
- One important note about private data: content you write belongs to your group. If you choose to leave the group, the group admin must approve data deletion if you wish to be removed from the system. You agree that it is upto the descetion of the coordinators of the gorup to remove data that you share with the group. You are free to remove your email adress and other personally identifying content except your name and username. We will ofcourse remove this infomraiton if a law is infringed upon or personal saftey is at risk.
