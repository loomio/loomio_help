## Guidelines

If your language distinguishes between personal and impersonal, use the more personal!

Make sure that you understand the different type of polls and activities that groups can do and that these are translated in way that is logical in your language.

Bear in mind the hyperlinks! The can be moved depending on the sentence structure of your language, so put them in place where you think it makes sense, not where they are placed in English.

## How to correctly translate code:

When you combine a translation string with some personal data you get something the user will understand. To make this work there are little bits of code within translation strings. It' takes a little practice to learn how to work with them.

### HTML tags:

`<h2>`, `<p>`, and `<a>` are html tags which describe if text is a heading, paragraph, link, and so on. There are often matching `</h2>`, `</p>`, and `</a>` codes.

Example of translating with html tags in place:

English
```
This poll has closed. <strong>Share the outcome</strong> with the group.
```

Spanish
```
Esta encuesta ha cerrado. <strong>Comparte el resultado</strong> con el grupo.
```

### Interpolation

There are two kinds of interpolation used in our strings:

Example 1

English
```
{% raw %}
Started by {{name}}
{% endraw %}
```

Spanish
```
{% raw %}
Iniciado por {{name}}
{% endraw %}
```

Example 2

English
```
Your request to join %{group_name} has been approved
```

Spanish
```
Tu solicitud para unirte a %{group_name} ha sido aprobada.
```

### Putting it all together - a complex example

English (source)
```
{% raw %}
<strong><a href='u/{{username}}'>{{author}}</a></strong> in reply to <strong>{{title}}</strong>
{% endraw %}
```

Spanish (translated)
```
{% raw %}
<strong><a href='u/{{username}}'>{{author}}</a></strong> en respuesta a <strong>{{title}}</strong>
{% endraw %}
```

### Working within a community of translators

As you translate, you might encounter questions like:
- should this use formal/ informal language ?
- who should I check this translation with ?

In a lot of cases, it's best to work through these challenges with other translators in your language.

Feel free to bring these questions up in the [Loomio Community - Translation](https://www.loomio.org/g/cpaM3Hsv/loomio-community-translation) group.
