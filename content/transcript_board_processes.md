Hi, this quick demonstration offers boards or structured groups a couple processes to get better outcomes with less time and effort, even with a remote team. Loomio aims to eliminate messy email chains and group messages, people feeling unheard, and time wasted in meetings. We offer a secure, online place where groups have discussions, make decisions together, and keep a record.

We often suggest people evaluate Loomio by replacing a routine their group already has; mundane procedures like ratifying the meeting minutes and collecting agenda items work great. Groups find a lot of benefit in taking care of this online, on people’s own time, rather than wasting precious time in person together.

Our next board meeting is approaching. Since there’s only a few things to prepare for it, Michael made one discussion thread for everything related to March’s meeting. He’s included all relevant details, links, and files so that people have them all in one place. Putting these in the thread’s context, which always remains at the top of the discussion, makes them easy for everyone to find.

Here he has started a “check” to invite us to approve last month’s minutes. In the details, he has briefly described how we might best interact with this check.

Although I’ve already voted, with an explanatory note, I can change my vote based on what someone else has shared.

Allowing people to change their vote, within the time limit, let’s us see where the group is at in the moment.

Now that we’ve seen how to quickly get the minutes approved, let’s try another process and see how we could make a quick but important decision online, without having to wait for our next meeting.

Our directors and officers insurance is due for renewal, as Michael has shared in this thread’s context. The group has had some time to comment and discuss here in this thread, and I now have a sense that there’s a solution that the group would likely act upon, so I’m going to start a proposal to move the conversation towards an actionable outcome.

After writing the title and description, I’ll set how long people have to respond. Beyond considerations of urgency and inclusion, it’s good to think about the date and time it ends as Loomio sends a reminder to participants when the proposal will close in 24 hours.

I definitely want all the board members to see this, and since they’re the only members of this group, I’ll use this button to send them all a notification that I’ve started this proposal.

Board members will arrive at this page and indicate their position and their reasoning, leaving a tidy record we could even reference to see what alternative we’d considered.

Once closed, Loomio enables you to set an outcome for each process, so that everyone is clear on what’s going to happen, and we have a record we can return to

There are a number of other decision tools that formal groups and boards may find useful, such as time polls to pick meeting times, but I’ll leave you with those two processes so you can get started saving your group precious hours and increasing productivity. Happy collaborating.
