Hi, this is a quick demonstration of Loomio’s decision tools, which help move conversations to action, and clear outcomes. We use Loomio to make better decisions, improve accountability and save time. No more messy notes or time lost recalling who was going to do that task, or what alternatives you had considered.

Use decision tools within any thread to get input, and outcomes to record decisions. See the Loomio overview video for all Loomio’s essentials and how they fit together.

Say I have a way forward that I believe the group will act on; I’ll start a proposal with a title reflecting what I’d like us to do. In this case, “let’s sponsor the benefit dinner”. It’s important that I share relevant details in the description, including what it means to agree to this proposal. What does sponsoring entail? If the proposal passes, what happens? If I want, I can share the proposal’s details in an attachment or linked document that won’t change while we’re voting.

Next I choose how long people have to respond. Beyond considerations of urgency and inclusion, it’s good to think about the date and time it ends as Loomio sends an alert 24 hrs before poll closes.

Now the decision’s started, I’ll likely want to alert everyone by selecting “Members of [my group]” to alert everyone, or i can choose a subset of people.

Members of the group or thread can select a response and leave a brief reason. As people vote, everyone can see how the group feels about it. As it progresses, new information may be offered and I may wish to change my vote; I can do so and again say why.

What if it’s a complicated decision? Maybe we want to talk about this in person. I can leave this proposal open and use another decision tool in the same thread or in a new one; here I’ll use a Time Poll to find the best date.

I pick dates and times, choose my settings... and start the poll, When people respond, they’re able to adjust their timezone in case they’re traveling. After we choose a time, I can send it directly to everyone’s calendars.

Now that the meeting time is set, I want to know who is attending. To find out, I’ll start a check, which is like asking folks to raise their hands or RSVP. I’ll ask people to check ‘yes’ if they are attending.

There are several more decision tools which I invite you to explore; use this link to learn more about how to use each. One last setting I’ll point out is ‘anonymous voting’; some people using Loomio for elections leave this setting such that voters remain anonymous.

Once a proposal closes I can set an outcome so the group knows what’s next and can look back at it later. If it closed too early, I can always re-open it. In my navigation panel I can find active and previous decisions, or I can look at the current or previous decisions within a group or a thread.

That’s the 101 on Loomio’s decisions tools. For advanced features or more guidance, see our comprehensive Help, online. Want to practice on a decision with your group right now? Try proposing something simple, like “I’m happy with the actions we determined in our last conversation”. Happy collaborating.
