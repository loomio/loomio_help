Hi, this is quick demonstration of how to use discussion threads in Loomio. Threads are a place for conversations, sharing information, and decision-making. They can improve participation by reducing email overload and making it easy for everyone to find the information they need.

Threads belong to groups; see the Loomio overview video for all Loomio’s essentials and how they fit together.

A thread begins with a title and some context, introducing the topic and framing the conversation or decision. The discussion occurs within comments below this. Anyone can comment. As I contribute to the discussion, there’s a couple of ways I can ensure my communications get to the right people at the right time. If I want input from a specific person, I’ll mention them using the @ symbol. I can also get people’s attention by replying to a comment they wrote or by leaving a reaction; I can use reactions to share how I feel or indicate I’ve read something without interrupting the discussion. Mentions and replies will send an email in addition to the notification within Loomio.

As soon as I created this thread, everyone in this group could immediately see it, but if I want them to see it even sooner, I can additionally alert them by inviting them to the thread. By default this will immediately email these people the discussion context, so they can easily reply by email or in Loomio.

From this screen, I can also invite people who are not part of my group; they will receive access to participating in this thread alone, with no access to the rest of my group’s information. For example, a group might consult a lawyer, and so they can invite the lawyer into a thread and have every comment and decision well documented, all in one place.

As the conversation progresses, I can update the thread context with any new clarity, focus, or files, so people can engage more quickly. The context is useful to support good documentation and engagement as it always remains at the top of the thread in order to provide the information people need to interact productively. Here I’ve linked a related discussion and a couple of key questions I want people to respond to.

We can attach any kind of file here, even from cloud storage, to aid the dialogue.

If a lot of people have commented, I can use these dropdowns to find what I need. “Nested” will make replies and votes appear directly under the comment or poll they are responding to.

When I want to move towards a clear outcome, I can use a decision tool to help; learn how to use them in our decision tools video. Decisions are another great way to get people’s attention.

My group members and I can always see this thread’s active decisions here in this column, and this thread’s previous decisions below.

That’s the basics of threads; see our help resource for advanced features. I invite you to try starting a discussion thread in your group; if you’re just starting with Loomio you could start a conversation entitled, “Should we use Loomio? If so, how?”. Happy collaborating.
